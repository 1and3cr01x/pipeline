# PipelineIO and Community Events 

PipelineIO is the main organizer and sponsor for the series of [Advanced Spark and TensorFlow Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/Advanced-Spark-and-TensorFlow-Meetup/) throughout the world.

With over 20,000 members globally, we frequently host highly-technical, in-person and online meetups in such high-tech cities as...

* San Francisco
* Chicago
* New York
* Washington DC
* London
* Berlin
* Toronto

...and many more.

In 2016 alone, we hosted 60+ free meetup community events throughout the world.  

While this dedication to the community requires a large amount of human and financial capital, we continue to push forward with close to 100+ global community events planned in 2017.

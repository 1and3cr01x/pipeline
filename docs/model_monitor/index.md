# Monitor Model
Metrics, dashboards, and visualizations are native to PipelineIO.  

We believe that you should have full insight into everything deployed to production.

PipelineIO provides the usual dashboards for real-time system metrics including memory usage, disk I/O and network throughput, CPU and GPU utilization of your model training and deployment activities.

In addition, PipelineIO provides dashboards for real-time model server metrics including latency, throughput, and health of your models in production.

## Example Dashboards

### Latency
Higher latency may lead to an unhealthy model server if left unbounded.

### Health
Unhealthy or latent services may open a [circuit](https://www.infoq.com/interviews/Building-Resilient-Systems-Michael-Nygard).  This causes the circuit to return a degraded, fallback response.

### Memory Usage
Higher memory usage beyond physical container or node limits may degrade performance.

### GPU Utilization
Higher, consistent utilization is preferred.  You want to saturate your cores, but not oversaturate them.

### Request Batch Size
Larger batch sizes usually provide higher throughput.

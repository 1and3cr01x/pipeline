## PipelineIO Workshop
*PipelineIO Distributed Spark ML + Tensorflow AI + GPU Workshop*

_Everybody gets their own GPU for the duration of the workshop!!_

We will each build an end-to-end, continuous, distributed Spark ML and Tensorflow AI model training and deployment pipeline on our own GPU-based cloud instance.

The only prequisites are a modern browser and an internet connection. We provide the rest including a GPU-based cloud instance for each attendee.

At the end of the workshop, each attendee can download the Docker image and run everything in your own cloud account.

*Agenda*

* Spark ML
* TensorFlow AI
* Storing and Serving Models with HDFS
* Trade-offs of CPU vs. GPU, Scale Up vs. Scale Out
* CUDA + cuDNN GPU Development Overview
* TensorFlow Model Checkpointing, Saving, Exporting, and Importing
* Distributed TensorFlow AI Model Training (Distributed Tensorflow)
* TensorFlow's Accelerated Linear Algebra Framework (XLA)
* TensorFlow's Just-in-Time (JIT) Compiler, Ahead of Time (AOT) Compiler
* Centralized Logging and Visualizing of Distributed TensorFlow Training (Tensorboard)
* Distributed Tensorflow AI Model Serving/Predicting (TensorFlow Serving)
* Centralized Logging and Metrics Collection (Prometheus, Grafana)

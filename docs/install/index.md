# Install PipelineIO in Your Environment
While we recommend the hosted [PipelineIO Community Edition](http://community.pipeline.io) when evaluating PipelineIO, we provide installation instructions below to setup PipelineIO in your own cloud-based or on-premise environment.

Note:  Support is limited for this offering, but we would love your feedback, bug reports, and feature requests [here](https://pipelineio.zendesk.com). 

## Setup Standalone PipelineIO
The standalone PipelineIO Community Edition uses a single Docker image that can run in any CPU and GPU-based environment that supports [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for CPUs or [Nvidia-Docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) for GPUs.

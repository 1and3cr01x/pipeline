# Installing PipelineIO Community Edition in Your Environment
While we recommend the hosted [PipelineIO Community Edition](http://community.pipeline.io), we offer PipelineIO Community Edition as a self-hosted solution using your own cloud-based or on-premise environment.

Installation instructions are below.  While [support](mailto:help@pipeline.io) is limited for the self-hosted offering, we would love your feedback and feature requests.   

## Standalone
The standalone PipelineIO Community Edition uses a single Docker image that can run in any CPU and GPU-based environment that supports [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for CPUs or [Nvidia-Docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) for GPUs.

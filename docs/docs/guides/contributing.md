Interested in helping us out? We are looking for help to port popular and useful machine learning and artificial intelligence models and runtimes into PipelineIO.

## What you need to do
- Create a GitHub issue.
- Run the project on PipelineIO (Training and Evaluation). Make sure the README has instructions on how to replicate what you've built.
- Email us links to the GitHub issue and your code.

## What you get in return
We will offer 50 hours of free GPU credits for each complete project ported.

## Miscellaneous
- The project should be open source under a liberal license (ie. Apache2, MIT)
- The project should use publicly-available training and validation data.

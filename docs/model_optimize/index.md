# Optimize a Model 
Upon deploying your model, PipelineIO will attempt to optimize your model for high-performance serving and predicting.

Various model optimization and simplification techniques include folding batch normalizations, quantizing weights, and generating native code for both CPU and GPU.

## Examples

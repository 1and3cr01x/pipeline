At the moment, every time you run a notebook - even if it's just plain Python and not PySpark - a long-running PySpark process is started which will occupy one(1) CPU Core.

Because you have a limited number of CPU Cores (4, 8, etc), you will quickly run out of CPU Cores - causing notebooks to hang.

Make sure you "Shutdown" notebooks that you are not using to free up the valuable CPU Cores.

over with things We struck a friendship up I spent a few long summers out on his old porch swing  Says he was in the war when in the navy Lost his wife, lost his baby Broke down and asked him one time How ya keep from going crazy He said I\u0027ll see my wife and son in just a little while I asked him what he meant He looked at me and smiled, said  (Chorus) I raise my hands, bow my head I\u0027m finding more and more truth in the words written in red They tell me that there\u0027s more to life than just what i can see Oh i believe  Few years later i was off at college  Talkin\u0027 to mom on the phone one night Getting all caught up on the gossip The ins and outs of the small town life She said oh by the way son, old man Wrigley\u0027s died.

mind and she didn\u0027t pay attention She was going way to fast Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass She saw both their lives flash before her eyes She didn\u0027t even have time to cry She was sooo scared She threw her hands up in the air Jesus take the wheel Take it from my hands Cause I can\u0027t do this all on my own I\u0027m letting go So give me one more chance To save me from this road I\u0027m on Jesus take the wheel  It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder And the car came to a stop She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock And for the first time in a long time She bowed her head to pray She said I\u0027m sorry for the way I\u0027ve been living my life I know I\u0027ve got to change So from

about all the times that we danced In moonlight to it all night long, oh Then miss me baby. And want me honey, Like you did the night you told me that you loved me We couldn\u0027t wait anymore. Left the keys in the door, took my hand Pulled me down on the kitchen floor. Yeah, we were that crazy Then miss me baby.  Chorus: Because when he\u0027s holding you, Know that it\u0027s killing me, Let my memory be the reason girl That you can\u0027t sleep And everytime you feel his touch, I pray to God it\u0027s not enough And that I\u0027ve touched your heart so deep Girl, you can\u0027t shake me Cause I love you, Yes I need you, Miss me baby.

Hill - Like We Never Loved At All\thttp://www.anycountrymusiclyrics.com/lyrics/133457/Faith_Hill/Like_We_Never_Loved_At_All\tYou never looked so good as you did last night, underneath the city lights, there walking with your friend, laughing at the moon. I swear you looked right through me. But I\u0027m still living with your goodbye, and you\u0027re just going on with your life. How can you just walk on by without one tear in your eye? Don\u0027t you have the slightest feelings left for me? Maybe that\u0027s just your way of dealing with the pain, forgetting everything between our rise and fall like we never loved at all.  You, I hear you\u0027re doing fine. Seems like you\u0027re doing well as far as I can tell. Time is leaving us behind, (time _ leaving us behind) another week has passed and still I haven\u0027t laughed yet. So tell me, what your secret is (I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know) to letting go, letting go like you did, like you did.  How can you just walk on by without one tear in your eye?

Thought she might do some cryin\u0027: lose some sleep at night. But he had no idea, when he hit the road, That without him in her life, she\u0027d let herself go. Let herself go on a singles cruise, To Vegas once, then to Honolulu. Let herself go to New York City: A week at the Spa; came back knocked-out pretty. When he said he didn\u0027t love her no more, She let herself go.  She poured her heart an\u0027 soul into their three-bedroom ranch. Spent her days raisin\u0027 babies, ironin\u0027 his pants. Came home one day from the grocery store and found his note, And without him there to stop her, she let herself go.  Let herself go on her first blind-date: Had the time of her life with some friends at the lake. Let herself go, buy a brand new car, Drove down to the beach he always said was too far. Sand sure felt good between her toes:  She let herself go on a singles cruise, To Vegas once, then to Honolulu. Let herself go to New York City: A week at the Spa; came back knocked-out pretty.

And I can see you loving me too, sure would be nice. Two hearts, one love . . . that\u0027s us.  I can see my lucky starts, when I gaze into your eyes. Twilight\u0027s shadows hold us tenderly. It\u0027s so easy to imagine, you here by my side as I turn out the lights and fall to sleep. I can see me being with you, for the rest of my life. Two hearts, one love.

in a cowboy hat And that Copenhagen smile And from buckin\u0027 broncs to honky tonks He always sang a cowboy\u0027s song We were much too young, havin\u0027 too much fun As we all sang along We sang Life\u0027s a Highway There\u0027s only one way you\u0027re gonna get through it When she starts to twist be more like Chris Pull your hat down tight And just LeDoux it! When that whistle blows And that crowd explodes And them pickup men are at your side They tell you good ride cowboy, good ride  From gold buckles to gold records Once again he was spinnin\u0027 \u0027round Took the whole world on And he turned us on to that Western Underground And from Bareback Jack to This Cowboy\u0027s Hat The songs were stronger than his pain He would not slow down from town to town Like children running thru the rain  We sang Life\u0027s a Highway There\u0027s only one way you\u0027re gonna get through it When she starts to twist be more like Chris Pull your hat down tight And just LeDoux it!

flowers grow, an\u0027 I pick a few, \u0027Cause she don\u0027t tell me to. I go out with my boys all right, But most of the time I call it a night before they do, \u0027Cause she don\u0027t tell me to. Sunday mornin\u0027, I\u0027m in church, An\u0027 my butt an\u0027 my back an\u0027 necktie hurt, but I\u0027m in the pew, She don\u0027t tell me to. Any other woman I know would have tried, To control me and it would be over. Plannin\u0027 on my goin\u0027 on my own way attitude. All of that stubborness melts away, When I wake with her head on my shoulder, An\u0027 I know I\u0027ve got to love her, Until my life is through, \u0027Cause she don\u0027t tell me to.  Well, I got demons and I\u0027ve got pride, But when I\u0027m wrong, I apologize like she\u0027s mine to lose, \u0027Cause she don\u0027t tell me to. Well, I got dreams in this heart of mine, But nothin\u0027 that I wouldn\u0027t lay aside if she asked me to. \u0027Cause she don\u0027t tell me to. An\u0027 she don\u0027t even know, That she keeps lookin\u0027 for the next right thing to do, \u0027Cause she don\u0027t tell me to. Yeah, yeah.  Any other woman I know would have tried, To control me and it would be over. Plannin\u0027 on my goin\u0027 on my own way attitude.

One thing I know No matter where I go I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks And I can feel That muddy water running through my veins And I can hear that lullaby of a midnight train It sings to me and it sounds familiar  (Chorus:) I feel no shame I\u0027m proud of where I came from I was born and raised in the boondocks One thing I know No matter where I go I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks  And I can taste That honeysuckle and it\u0027s still so sweet When it grows wild On the banks down at old camp creek Yeah, and it calls to me like a warm wind blowing  (Chorus:) I feel no shame I\u0027m proud of where I came from I was born and raised in the boondocks One thing I know No matter where I go I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks  It\u0027s where I learned about living It\u0027s where I learned about love It\u0027s where I learned about working hard And having a little was just enough  It\u0027s where I learned about Jesus And knowing where I stand You can take it or leave it, this is me This is who I am  Give me a tin roof A front porch and a gravel road And that\u0027s home to me It feels like home to me  (Chorus)  I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks  You get a line, I\u0027ll get a pole We\u0027ll go fishing in the crawfish hole Five-card poker on a Saturday night Church on Sunday morning  (2x) You get a line, I\u0027ll get a pole We\u0027ll go

eyes everyone is equal Darkness turns to light and the world is at peace This miracle God gave to me gives me strength when I am weak I find reason to believe In my daughter\u0027s eyes  And when she wraps her hand around my finger Oh it puts a smile in my heart Everything becomes a little clearer I realize what life is all about  It\u0027s hangin\u0027 on when your heart has had enough It\u0027s giving more when you feel like giving up I\u0027ve seen the light It\u0027s in my daugter\u0027s eyes  In my daughter\u0027s eyes I can see the future A reflection of who I am and what will be Though

Bamford - All About Her\thttp://www.anycountrymusiclyrics.com/lyrics/133441/Gord_Bamford/All_About_Her\tI used to wonder what they meant By walking the floor Now there\u0027s grooves under my boots And I don\u0027t wonder anymore All those simple country songs Have so much meaning since I lost her They go right through my heart Not in one ear and out the other Like when my Daddy spun that vinyl Of Hank Snow and Charlie Pride It always caught Momma\u0027s attention And she\u0027d just break right down and cry But I\u0027d just listen to the pickin\u0027 \u0027Cause that\u0027s the only part I liked I didn\u0027t understand the words Now they\u0027re all about her  We went out walkin\u0027 after midnight Now I do it alone It seems like one day she was with me And the next day she was gone There\u0027s a high lonesome sound And the melody is whistling I remember from my childhood When I didn\u0027t know what I was missing  Like when my Daddy spun that vinyl Of Kitty Wells and Loretta Lynn It always caught Momma\u0027s attention And she\u0027d just break right down again But I\u0027d just listen to the pickin\u0027 The only part that pulled me in I didn\u0027t understand the words Now they\u0027re all about her  Here\u0027s to pick-up trucks and good dogs And heartaches I\u0027m gonna listen to what gets me through If that\u0027s what it takes  So now when I spin my records Of George Strait and Tim McGraw I close my eyes and let that lyric Catch me when I fall I still listen to the pickin\u0027 Yes I do but that\u0027s not all Now that I understand the words And

headlights on the interstate I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake Ever since you found yourself in someone else\u0027s arms I\u0027ve been tryin\u0027 my best to get along But that\u0027s OK There\u0027s nothing left to say, but Take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don\u0027t need\u0027em Take your space and take your reasons But you\u0027ll think of me And take your cat and leave my sweater \u0027Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I\u0027ll feel a whole lot better But you\u0027ll think of me, you\u0027ll think of me  I went out driving trying to clear my head I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left I guess I\u0027m feeling just a little tired of this And all the baggage that seems to still exist It seems the only blessing I have left to my name Is not knowing what we could have been What we should have been So  Take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don\u0027t need\u0027em Take your space and take your reasons But you\u0027ll think of me And take your cat and leave my sweater \u0027Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I\u0027ll feel a whole lot better But you\u0027ll think of me  Someday I\u0027m gonna run across your mind Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll be fine I\u0027m gonna be alright While you\u0027re sleeping with your pride Wishing I could hold you tight I\u0027ll be over you  And on with my life  So take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don\u0027t need\u0027em And take your cat and leave my sweater \u0027Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I\u0027ll feel a whole lot better But you\u0027ll think of me  So take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don\u0027t need\u0027em

You don\u0027t wanna read that thing, man, It\u0027s a real get-you-downer. But don\u0027t you dare say nothin\u0027 else, Bad about her: she\u0027s gone. No, no, no, no, don\u0027t, don\u0027t throw it away, \u0027Cause tonight, I might need it. It gets real lonely around here at night some times, An\u0027 I have to read read it. Besides, you can show it to the boys down town, They won\u0027t believe that she\u0027s gone.  There used to be a time I was all she ever wanted. All the man that she\u0027ll ever need. I come home to find, just like that, she\u0027s up an\u0027 vanished. An\u0027 the only thing she left behind for me:  Is this big blue note, Folded up in my pocket. Yeah, don\u0027t laugh: it\u0027s been two months; I still got it. Sometimes I have to read the sucker twice, Just to make sure I ain\u0027t forgot that she\u0027s gone.  You know, my psychiatrist said: \"Tell me, what do you see, \"When you look at these inkspots, \"Of, er, reds, yellows an\u0027 greens?\" You know, I looked at \u0027em all, But they all looked to me like big blue notes.  There used to be a time I was all she ever wanted. All the man that she\u0027ll ever need. I come home to find, just like that, she\u0027s up an\u0027 vanished. An\u0027 the only thing that\u0027s left to do for me:  Is stand high on this cliff, Overlooking the sea. With my big blue notepaper aeroplane, That I just set free. An\u0027 I\u0027m gonna wait here a few more minutes, An\u0027 if it don\u0027t come back to me: You guessed it: she\u0027s gone.  Crash landing.

Griggs - If Heaven\thttp://www.anycountrymusiclyrics.com/lyrics/133364/Andy_Griggs/If_Heaven\tIf Heaven was an hour, it would be twilight, When the fireflies start their dancin\u0027 on the lawn; An\u0027 supper\u0027s on the stove and Mamma\u0027s laughin\u0027, And everybodys workin\u0027 day is done. If Heaven was a town, it would be my town, Oh, on a summer day in 1985. An\u0027 everything I wanted was out there waitin\u0027, And everyone I loved was still alive.  Don\u0027t cry a tear for me, now, baby; There comes a time we all must say goodbye. And if that\u0027s what Heaven\u0027s made of, You know, I, I ain\u0027t afraid to die.  If Heaven was a pie, it\u0027d be cherry, So cool and sweet an\u0027 heavy on the tongue. An\u0027 just one bite would satisfy your hunger, An\u0027 there\u0027d always be enough for everyone.  If Heaven was a train, it sure would be a fast one, That could take this weary traveller around the bend. If Heaven was a tear, it\u0027d be my last one, An\u0027 you\u0027d be in my arms again.  Don\u0027t cry a tear for me, now, baby; There comes a time we all must say goodbye. And if that\u0027s what Heaven\u0027s made of, You know, I, I ain\u0027t afraid to die.

spent his whole life tryin\u0027 to forget We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind Until the night 1st Chorus He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger And finally drank away her memory Life is short but this time it was bigger Than the strength he had to get up off his knees We found him with his face down in the pillow With a note that said I\u0027ll love her till I die And when we buried him beneath the willow The angels sang a whiskey lullaby  (Sing lullaby)  The rumors flew but nobody know how much she blamed herself For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath She finally drank her pain away a little at a time But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind Until the night  2nd Chorus She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger And finally drank away is memory Life is short but this time it was bigger Than the strength she had to get up off her knees We found her with her face down in the pillow Clinging to his picture for dear life We laid her next to him beneath the willow While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby\tWrappedArray(she, put,

And it don\u0027t matter if you don\u0027t believe, Come Sunday morning you best be there In the front row, like you\u0027re s\u0027posed to.  Same hurt in every heart. Same trailer, different park.  Mamas hooked on Mary Kay Brothers hooked on Mary Jane And Daddies hooked on Mary two doors down.  Mary Mary quite contrary, We get bored so we get married And just like dust we settle in this town. On this broken merry go \u0027round and \u0027round and \u0027round we go, Where it stops nobody knows... And it ain\u0027t slowin\u0027 down, this merry go \u0027round...  We think the first time\u0027s good enough, So we hold on to high school love, Say we won\u0027t end up like our parents.  Tiny little boxes in a row, Ain\u0027t want you want it\u0027s what you know, Just happy in the shoes you\u0027re wearin\u0027.  Same checks we\u0027re always cashin\u0027, To buy a little more distraction.  Cause Mamas hooked on Mary Kay Brothers hooked on Mary Jane Daddies hooked on Mary two doors down.

Tiger\u0027s football score It said he was only eighteen, a boy about my age They found him face down on the bedroom floor There\u0027ll be services on Friday at the Lawrence Funeral Home Then out on Mooresville highway, they\u0027ll lay him \u0027neath a stone...

Did he lose a fight with drugs or alcohol? Did his Mom and Daddy forget to say I love you son? Did no one see the writing on the wall?

driving across country, in a dusty old RV Just the road and its majesty And I\u0027m looking at you with the world in the rear view Chorus- You were pretty as can be, sitting in the front seat  Looking at me, telling me you love me ,and your happy to be,  With me on the 4th of July We sang Stranglehold to the stereo  Couldn\u0027t take no more of that rock n roll So we put on a little George Jones and just sang along     Those white lines get drawn into the sun if you aint got no one To keep you hanging on And there you were like a queen with your nightgown, riding shotgun from town to town  Staking a claim on the world we found And I\u0027m singing to you, your singing to me ,you were out of the blue to a boy like me Chorus- You were pretty as can be, sitting in the front seat  Looking at me, telling me you love me ,and your happy to be,  With me on the 4th of July We sang Stranglehold to the stereo  Couldn\u0027t take no more of that rock n roll So we put on a little George Jones and just sang along and im looking for you in the silence that we share Chorus- You were pretty as can be, sitting in the front seat  Looking at me, telling me you love me ,and your happy to be,

So much for ditchin\u0027 this town, An\u0027 hangin\u0027 out on the coast. Oh well, those plans are long gone. And he said: \"There goes my life. \"There goes my future, my everything.  \"Might as well kiss it all good-bye: \"There goes my life.\"  A couple years of up all night, An\u0027 a few thousand diapers later. That mistake he thought he made, Covers up the refrigerator: Oh yeah, he loves that little girl.  An\u0027 Momma\u0027s waiting to tuck her in,  As she fumbles up those stairs. She smiles back at him, Dragging that teddy bear: \"Sleep tight.\" Blue eyes and bouncing curls.  An\u0027 he smiles: \"There goes my life \"There goes my future, my everything.\"  \"I love you, Daddy, goodnight.\" \"There goes my life.\"  She had that Honda loaded down, With Abercrombie clothes, An\u0027 and fifteen pairs of shoes, An\u0027 his American Express. He checked the oil and slammed the hood, Said: \"You\u0027re good to go.\" She hugged them both, An\u0027d headed off to the west coast.

a word you can light up the dark Try as I may I could never explain What I hear when you don\u0027t say a thing The smile on your face lets me know that you need me There\u0027s a truth in your eyes saying you\u0027ll never leave me A touch of your hand says you\u0027ll catch me if ever I fall Now you say it best, when you say nothing at all  All day long I can hear people talking out loud But when you hold me near you drown out the crowd Old Mister Webster could never define What\u0027s being said between your heart and mine  The smile on your face lets me know that you need me There\u0027s a truth in your eyes saying you\u0027ll never leave me A touch of your hand says you\u0027ll catch me if ever I fall Now you say it best, when you say nothing at all  The smile on your face lets me know that you need me There\u0027s a truth in your eyes saying you\u0027ll never leave me A touch of your hand says you\u0027ll catch me if ever I fall Now you say it best, when you say

down in a booth at a cafe there Gave his order to the girl with a bow in her hair He\u0027s a little shy so she gave him a smile So he said would you mind sittin\u0027 down for a while And talkin\u0027 to me I\u0027m feelin\u0027 a little low She said I\u0027m off in an hour and I know where we can go So they went down and they sat on the pier He said I bet you got a boyfriend but I don\u0027t care I\u0027ve got no one to send a letter to Would you mind if I sent one back here to you?  CHORUS: I cried Never gonna hold the hand of another guy Too young for him they told her Waitin\u0027 for the love of the travelin\u0027 soldier Our love will never end Waitin\u0027 for the soldier to come back again Never more to be alone When the letter says a soldier\u0027s coming home  So the letters came From an army camp In California then Vietnam And he told his heart It might be love And all of the things he was so scared of Said when it\u0027s gettin kinda tough over here I think about that day sittin\u0027 down at the pier And close my eyes and see your pretty smile Now don\u0027t

rocked Central Park to a half a million fans, screaming out her name She\u0027s never hit a shot to win the game She\u0027s never left her footprints on the moon She\u0027s never made a solo hot air balloon ride, around the world, No, she\u0027s just your everyday average girl (but) She\u0027s somebody\u0027s hero A hero to her baby with a skinned up knee A little kiss is all she needs The keeper of the cheerios The voice that brings Snow White to life Bedtime stories every night And that smile lets her know She\u0027s somebody\u0027s hero  She didn\u0027t get a check every week like a nine-to fiver But she\u0027s been a waiter, and a cook and a taxi driver For twenty years, there at home, until the day her girl was grown Giving all her love to her was her life\u0027s ambition But now her baby\u0027s movin\u0027 on, and she\u0027ll soon be missin\u0027 her But not today, those are tears of joy runnin\u0027 down her face  She\u0027s somebody\u0027s hero A hero to her daughter in her wedding dress She gave her wings to leave the nest It hurts to let her baby go down the aisle she walks right by Looks back into her mother\u0027s eyes And that smile lets her know She\u0027s somebody\u0027s hero  Thirty years have flown right past Her daughters\u0027 starin\u0027 at all the photographs Of her mother, and she wishes she could be like that Oh, but she already is  She\u0027s somebody\u0027s hero A hero to her mother in a rockin\u0027 chair She runs a brush through her silver hair The envy of the nursing home She drops by every afternoon Feeds her mama with a spoon And

that hunger May you never take one single breath for granted God forbid love ever leave you empty handed I hope you still feel small When you stand by the ocean Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens Promise me you\u0027ll give fate a fighting chance And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance I hope you dance I hope you dance  I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance Never settle for the path of least resistance Living might mean taking chances But they\u0027re worth taking Lovin\u0027 might be a mistake But it\u0027s worth making Don\u0027t let some hell bent heart Leave you bitter When you come close to selling out Reconsider Give the heavens above More than just a passing glance  And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance I hope you dance (Time is a wheel in constant motion always) I hope you dance (Rolling us along) I hope you dance (Tell me who) I hope you dance (Wants to look back on their years and wonder) (Where those years have gone)  I hope you still feel small When you stand by the ocean Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens Promise me you\u0027ll give faith a fighting chance  And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance Dance I hope you dance I hope you dance (Time is a wheel in constant motion always) I hope you dance (Rolling us along) I hope you dance (Tell me who) (Wants to look back on their

Allan - Songs About Rain\thttp://www.anycountrymusiclyrics.com/lyrics/133104/Gary_Allan/Songs_About_Rain\tWell this town has closed down way too early,  And there\u0027s nothing to do, So I\u0027m driving around in circles,  And I\u0027m thinking about you, Today I heard you got a new last name, Sure didn\u0027t know it was gonna hit me this way, And the radio just keeps on playing all these songs about rain Now there\u0027s all kind of songs about babies and love that goes right, But for some unknown reason nobody wants to play them tonight, Hey I hope it\u0027s sunny wherever you are, But that\u0027s sure not the picture tonight in my car,  And it sure ain\u0027t easing my pain all these songs like, Rainy Night In Georgia, and Kentucky Rain, Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again,  Blue Eyes Crying In The early morning Rain, They go on and on, And there\u0027s no two the same,  Oh it would be easy to blame all these songs about rain, Well I thought I was over you but I guess maybe I\u0027m not, Cause when I let you go looks like lonely is all that I got, Guess I\u0027ll never know what could have been, Sure ain\u0027t helping this mood that I\u0027m in, If their gonna keep on playing me songs like,  Rainy Night In Georgia, and Kentucky Rain, Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again,  Blue Eyes Crying In The early morning Rain, They go on and on, And there\u0027s no

She dreams she\u0027s dancing  Around and around without any cares  And her very first love is holding her close  And the soft wind in blowing her hair  Sarah Beth is scared to death  As she sits holding her mom  Says it would be a mistake  For someone to take  A girl with no hair to the prom  Oh, just this morning right there on her pillow  Was the coolest of any surprise  And she cried when she gathered it all in her hands  The proof that she couldn\u0027t deny  Sarah Beth closes her eyes  She dreams she\u0027s dancing  Around and around without any cares \tWrappedArray(sarah, beth, is,

every time he sees an opening In a conversation about the way things used to be Well I\u0027d just roll my eyes and make a bee-line for the door But I\u0027d always wind up starry-eyed, cross-legged on the floor Hanging on to every word Man, the things I heard It was harder times and longer days Five miles to school, uphill both ways We were cane switch raised, and dirt floor poor \u0027Course that was back before the war Yeah, your uncle and I made quite a pair Flying F-15\u0027s through hostile air He went down but they missed me by a hair He\u0027d always stop right there and say...  That\u0027s something to be proud of That\u0027s a life you can hang your hat on That\u0027s a chin held high as the tears fall down A gut sucked in, a chest stuck out Like a small town flag a-flyin\u0027 Or a newborn baby cryin\u0027 In the arms of the woman that you love That\u0027s something to be proud of  So I\u0027m graduatin\u0027 college, that was mama\u0027s dream But I was on my way to anywhere else when I turned 18 Cuz when you gotta fast car you think you\u0027ve got everything I learned quick those GTO\u0027s don\u0027t run on faith I ended up broken down in some town north of L.A. Working maximum hours for minimum wage Well, I fell in love, next thing I know The babies came, the car got slow I sure do miss that old hot rod But you sure save gas in them foreign jobs Dad, I wonder if I ever let you down If you\u0027re ashamed how I turned out Well, he lowered his voice, then he raised his brow Said, lemme tell ya right now  That\u0027s something to be proud of

about all the times that we danced In moonlight to it all night long, oh Then miss me baby. And want me honey, Like you did the night you told me that you loved me We couldn\u0027t wait anymore. Left the keys in the door, took my hand Pulled me down on the kitchen floor. Yeah, we were that crazy Then miss me baby.  Chorus: Because when he\u0027s holding you, Know that it\u0027s killing me, Let my memory be the reason girl That you can\u0027t sleep And everytime you feel his touch, I pray to God it\u0027s not enough And that I\u0027ve touched your heart so deep Girl, you can\u0027t shake me Cause I love you, Yes I need you, Miss me baby.

Hill - Like We Never Loved At All\thttp://www.anycountrymusiclyrics.com/lyrics/133457/Faith_Hill/Like_We_Never_Loved_At_All\tYou never looked so good as you did last night, underneath the city lights, there walking with your friend, laughing at the moon. I swear you looked right through me. But I\u0027m still living with your goodbye, and you\u0027re just going on with your life. How can you just walk on by without one tear in your eye? Don\u0027t you have the slightest feelings left for me? Maybe that\u0027s just your way of dealing with the pain, forgetting everything between our rise and fall like we never loved at all.  You, I hear you\u0027re doing fine. Seems like you\u0027re doing well as far as I can tell. Time is leaving us behind, (time _ leaving us behind) another week has passed and still I haven\u0027t laughed yet. So tell me, what your secret is (I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know) to letting go, letting go like you did, like you did.  How can you just walk on by without one tear in your eye?

Let herself go on a singles cruise, To Vegas once, then to Honolulu. Let herself go to New York City: A week at the Spa; came back knocked-out pretty. When he said he didn\u0027t love her no more, She let herself go.  She poured her heart an\u0027 soul into their three-bedroom ranch. Spent her days raisin\u0027 babies, ironin\u0027 his pants. Came home one day from the grocery store and found his note, And without him there to stop her, she let herself go.  Let herself go on her first blind-date: Had the time of her life with some friends at the lake. Let herself go, buy a brand new car, Drove down to the beach he always said was too far. Sand sure felt good between her toes:  She let herself go on a singles cruise, To Vegas once, then to Honolulu. Let herself go to New York City: A week at the Spa; came back knocked-out pretty.

But this time it\u0027s my heart, with a dream that\u0027s here to stay. There\u0027s a chance this one might come true.  I can see me being with you, for the rest of my life. Two hearts, one love. And I can see you loving me too, sure would be nice. Two hearts, one love . . . that\u0027s us.  I can see my lucky starts, when I gaze into your eyes. Twilight\u0027s shadows hold us tenderly. It\u0027s so easy to imagine, you here by my side as I turn out the lights and fall to sleep. I can see me being with you, for the rest of my life. Two hearts, one love.  And I can see you loving me too, sure would be nice. Two hearts, one love . . . that\u0027s us. I can see me being with you, for the rest of my life. Two hearts, one love.

wraps her hand around my finger Oh it puts a smile in my heart Everything becomes a little clearer I realize what life is all about  It\u0027s hangin\u0027 on when your heart has had enough It\u0027s giving more when you feel like giving up I\u0027ve seen the light It\u0027s in my daugter\u0027s eyes  In my daughter\u0027s eyes I can see the future A reflection of who I am and what will be Though

George Strait and Tim McGraw I close my eyes and let that lyric Catch me when I fall I still listen to the pickin\u0027 Yes I do but that\u0027s not all Now that I understand the words And

However long it takes I\u0027m never giving up No matter what, I love you this much  He grew to hate him for what he had done \u0027Cause what kind of a father, could do that to his son He said \u0027damn you daddy\u0027, the day that he died The man didn\u0027t blink, but the little boy cried  Chorus  Half way through the service While the choir sand a hymn He looked up above the preacher

Urban - You\u0027ll Think Of Me\thttp://www.anycountrymusiclyrics.com/lyrics/133125/Keith_Urban/You\u0027ll_Think_Of_Me\tI woke up early this morning around 4am With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake Ever since you found yourself in someone else\u0027s arms I\u0027ve been tryin\u0027 my best to get along But that\u0027s OK There\u0027s nothing left to say, but Take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don\u0027t need\u0027em Take your space and take your reasons But you\u0027ll think of me And take your cat and leave my sweater \u0027Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I\u0027ll feel a whole lot better But you\u0027ll think of me, you\u0027ll think of me  I went out driving trying to clear my head I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left I guess I\u0027m feeling just a little tired of this And all the baggage that seems to still exist It seems the only blessing I have left to my name Is not knowing what we could have been What we should have been So  Take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don\u0027t need\u0027em Take your space and take your reasons But you\u0027ll think of me And take your cat and leave my sweater \u0027Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I\u0027ll feel a whole lot better But you\u0027ll think of me  Someday I\u0027m gonna run across your mind Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll be fine I\u0027m gonna be alright While you\u0027re sleeping with your pride Wishing I could hold you tight I\u0027ll be over you  And on with my life  So take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don\u0027t need\u0027em And take your cat and leave my sweater \u0027Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I\u0027ll feel a whole lot better But you\u0027ll think of me  So take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don\u0027t need\u0027em Take your space and all your reasons But you\u0027ll think of me And take your cat and leave my sweater \u0027Cause we got nothing left to weather In fact I\u0027ll feel a whole lot better But

You don\u0027t wanna read that thing, man, It\u0027s a real get-you-downer. But don\u0027t you dare say nothin\u0027 else, Bad about her: she\u0027s gone. No, no, no, no, don\u0027t, don\u0027t throw it away, \u0027Cause tonight, I might need it. It gets real lonely around here at night some times, An\u0027 I have to read read it. Besides, you can show it to the boys down town, They won\u0027t believe that she\u0027s gone.  There used to be a time I was all she ever wanted. All the man that she\u0027ll ever need. I come home to find, just like that, she\u0027s up an\u0027 vanished. An\u0027 the only thing she left behind for me:  Is this big blue note, Folded up in my pocket. Yeah, don\u0027t laugh: it\u0027s been two months; I still got it. Sometimes I have to read the sucker twice, Just to make sure I ain\u0027t forgot that she\u0027s gone.  You know, my psychiatrist said: \"Tell me, what do you see, \"When you look at these inkspots, \"Of, er, reds, yellows an\u0027 greens?\" You know, I looked at \u0027em all, But they all looked to me like big blue notes.  There used to be a time I was all she ever wanted. All the man that she\u0027ll ever need. I come home to find, just like that, she\u0027s up an\u0027 vanished. An\u0027 the only thing that\u0027s left to do for me:  Is stand high on this cliff, Overlooking the sea. With my big blue notepaper aeroplane, That I just set free.

If Heaven\thttp://www.anycountrymusiclyrics.com/lyrics/133364/Andy_Griggs/If_Heaven\tIf Heaven was an hour, it would be twilight, When the fireflies start their dancin\u0027 on the lawn; An\u0027 supper\u0027s on the stove and Mamma\u0027s laughin\u0027, And everybodys workin\u0027 day is done. If Heaven was a town, it would be my town, Oh, on a summer day in 1985. An\u0027 everything I wanted was out there waitin\u0027, And everyone I loved was still alive.  Don\u0027t cry a tear for me, now, baby; There comes a time we all must say goodbye. And if that\u0027s what Heaven\u0027s made of, You know, I, I ain\u0027t afraid to die.  If Heaven was a pie, it\u0027d be cherry, So cool and sweet an\u0027 heavy on the tongue. An\u0027 just one bite would satisfy your hunger, An\u0027 there\u0027d always be enough for everyone.

And it don\u0027t matter if you don\u0027t believe, Come Sunday morning you best be there In the front row, like you\u0027re s\u0027posed to.  Same hurt in every heart. Same trailer, different park.  Mamas hooked on Mary Kay Brothers hooked on Mary Jane And Daddies hooked on Mary two doors down.  Mary Mary quite contrary, We get bored so we get married And just like dust we settle in this town. On this broken merry go \u0027round and \u0027round and \u0027round we go, Where it stops nobody knows... And it ain\u0027t slowin\u0027 down, this merry go \u0027round...  We think the first time\u0027s good enough, So we hold on to high school love, Say we won\u0027t end up like our parents.  Tiny little boxes in a row, Ain\u0027t want you want it\u0027s what you know, Just happy in the shoes you\u0027re wearin\u0027.  Same checks we\u0027re always cashin\u0027, To buy a little more distraction.  Cause Mamas hooked on Mary Kay Brothers hooked on Mary Jane Daddies hooked on Mary two doors down.

saying you\u0027ll never leave me A touch of your hand says you\u0027ll catch me if ever I fall Now you say it best, when you say nothing at all  All day long I can hear people talking out loud But

An\u0027 poor Cow Patty, an\u0027 swervin\u0027 Marlin, ha ha,  Are gonna find it tough to beat Mark Martin.  \u0027Cause that Viagra car is always driven hard.

It\u0027s it\u0027s beer an Mohawks.  Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, I love NASCAR.  I like short tracks, you\u0027ll see more wrecks,  An\u0027 about a million screamin\u0027 rednecks.

(I like football.)  I like my wrestlin\u0027.  I like a good game of air hockey,  I like some pinball now an\u0027 then.  How about you, Toby?  I love NASCAR, it\u0027s my kind of race.  Just to see Big E back on the track,  Would put a smile on every face.  No-one drove a car quite like Earnhardt.  Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, I love NASCAR.

rocked Central Park to a half a million fans, screaming out her name She\u0027s never hit a shot to win the game She\u0027s never left her footprints on the moon She\u0027s never made a solo hot air balloon ride, around the world, No, she\u0027s just your everyday average girl (but) She\u0027s somebody\u0027s hero A hero to her baby with a skinned up knee A little kiss is all she needs The keeper of the cheerios The voice that brings Snow White to life Bedtime stories every night And that smile lets her know She\u0027s somebody\u0027s hero  She didn\u0027t get a check every week like a nine-to fiver But she\u0027s been a waiter, and a cook and a taxi driver For twenty years, there at home, until the day her girl was grown Giving all her love to her was her life\u0027s ambition But now her baby\u0027s movin\u0027 on, and she\u0027ll soon be missin\u0027 her But not today, those are tears of joy runnin\u0027 down her face  She\u0027s somebody\u0027s hero A hero to her daughter in her wedding dress She gave her wings to leave the nest It hurts to let her baby go down the aisle she walks right by Looks back into her mother\u0027s eyes And that smile lets her know She\u0027s somebody\u0027s hero  Thirty years have flown right past Her daughters\u0027 starin\u0027 at all the photographs Of her mother, and she wishes she could be like that Oh, but she already is  She\u0027s somebody\u0027s hero A hero to her mother in a rockin\u0027 chair She runs a brush through her silver hair The envy of the nursing home She drops by every afternoon Feeds her mama with a spoon And

that hunger May you never take one single breath for granted God forbid love ever leave you empty handed I hope you still feel small When you stand by the ocean Whenever one door closes, I hope one

Allan - Songs About Rain\thttp://www.anycountrymusiclyrics.com/lyrics/133104/Gary_Allan/Songs_About_Rain\tWell this town has closed down way too early,  And there\u0027s nothing to do, So I\u0027m driving around in circles,  And I\u0027m thinking about you, Today I heard you got a new last name, Sure didn\u0027t know it was gonna hit me this way, And the radio just keeps on playing all these songs about rain Now there\u0027s all kind of songs about babies and love that goes right, But for some unknown reason nobody wants to play them tonight, Hey I hope it\u0027s sunny wherever you are, But that\u0027s sure not the picture tonight in my car,  And it sure ain\u0027t easing my pain all these songs like, Rainy Night In Georgia, and Kentucky Rain, Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again,  Blue Eyes Crying In The early morning Rain, They go on and on, And there\u0027s no two the same,  Oh it would be easy to blame all these songs about rain, Well I thought I was over you but I guess maybe I\u0027m not, Cause when I let you go looks like lonely is all that I got, Guess I\u0027ll never know what could have been, Sure ain\u0027t helping this mood that I\u0027m in, If their gonna keep on playing me songs like,  Rainy Night In Georgia, and Kentucky Rain, Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again,  Blue Eyes Crying In The early morning Rain, They go on and on, And there\u0027s no two the same,  Oh how I wish I could blame all these songs about rain, All these songs about rain, Songs about rain.......\tWrappedArray(well, this, town, has, closed, down, way, too, early, and,

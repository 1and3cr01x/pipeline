Payment, Refunds, Upgrading and Downgrading Terms\n\n\n\n\nYou are not required to provide a credit card number to open an account.\n\n\nOnce your free trial period has ended you will be required to enter a credit card to continue usage.\n\n\nAny usage once you enter credit card information will immediately incur a usage charge.\n\n\nPipelineIO calculates your server usage in seconds and bills you for that amount of usage at the prevailing rates displayed on our web site. We track your usage in seconds and charge you for the fraction of an hour that you used. So if you only use 5 minutes, you'll only be billed for 5 minutes. Please note that we will round each charge up to the nearest cent (so the minimum charge is 1 cent).\n\n\nRoughly once a month, we will bill you for the usage charges you have accrued over the preceding month (unless other payment terms have been arranged).\n\n\nAll fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or state) taxes.\n\n\nDowngrading your Service may cause the loss of Content, features, or capacity of your Account. PipelineIO does not accept any liability for such loss.\n\n\n\n\nD. Cancellation and Termination\n\n\nYou are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. Contact help@pipeline.io for canceling your account.\n\n\nPipelineIO, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service, or any other PipelineIO service, for any reason at any time. Such termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content in your Account. PipelineIO reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time\n\n\nE. Modification of the Services\n\n\nPipelineIO reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice.\n\n\nPrices of all Services, including but not limited to monthly subscription plan fees to the Service, are subject to change upon 30 days notice from us (unless you have agreed otherwise with PipelineIO). Such notice may be provided at any time by posting the changes to the PipelineIO Site (Pipeline.io) or the Service itself.\n\n\nPipelineIO shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.\n\n\nF.

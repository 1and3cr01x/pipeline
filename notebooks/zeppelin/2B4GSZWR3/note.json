The data consists of about 100 million movie ratings, and the goal is to predict missing entries in the movie-user rating matrix.\n\n| Field | Value |\n|----------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Data Set Characteristics: | Multivariate, Time-Series |\n| Attribute Characteristics: | Integer |\n| Associated Tasks: | Clustering, Recommender-Systems |\n| Number of Instances: | 100480507 |\n| Number of Attributes: | 17770 |\n| Missing Values? | Yes |\n| Area: | N/A |\n| Date Donated | 2009-09-21 |\n\n\nSource:\nThe Netflix Prize \nhttp://www.netflixprize.com \n\n\nData Set Information:\n\nThis dataset was constructed to support participants in the Netflix Prize. \n\nThere are over 480,000 customers in the dataset, each identified by a unique integer id. \n\nThe title and release year for each movie is also provided. There are over 17,000 movies in the dataset, each identified by a unique integer id. \n\nThe dataset contains over 100 million ratings. The ratings were collected between October 1998 and December 2005 and reflect the distribution of all ratings received during this period. Each rating has a customer id, a movie id, the date of the rating, and the value of the rating. \n\nAs part of the original Netflix Prize a set of ratings was identified whose rating values were not provided in the original dataset. The object of the Prize was to accurately predict the ratings from this \u0027qualifying\u0027 set. These missing ratings are now available in the grand_prize.tar.gz dataset file.\n\n\nAttribute Information:\n\nThe format of the data is described fully in the README files contained in the dataset tar files. \n\nMovieID: \nArbitrarily assigned unique integer in the range [1 .. 17770]. \n\nCustomerID: \nArbitrarily assigned unique integer in the range [1..2649429] (with gaps). \n\nRating: \nNumber of \u0027stars\u0027 assigned to a movie by a customer; an integer from 1 to 5. \n\nTitle: \nEnglish language title of the movie on the Netflix website. \n\nYearOfRelease: \nYear a movie was released in the range [1890..2005].
